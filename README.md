**VOIDVENTURE**

Adventure in the Void (Voidventure) is a vertical space shooter game framework developed in Unity, featuring a library of minimal, functional code and a sample project that allows users to learn from and iterate on to make their own space shooter game.

The framework features usual space shooter mechanics: gameplay on a 2D plane with a controllable player, enemy waves, and basic shooting and dodging functionality (extra lives). Beyond that, it includes additional features such as:
A scoring system with score display and local leaderboards so players can save, view and keep track of their scores.
Online leaderboards for competitive purposes. In the sample project, 3 different leaderboard managers are offered - using Dreamlo, Danqzq Leaderboard Creator and Unity’s official SDK - to give users a choice of which to implement in their own game

Voidventure seeks to help players learn Unity game development in an organic way, using a sample game with functional and scalable code instead of starting from scratch.
